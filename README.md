I'm sorry about the conversion to OpenWeatherMap types of icon. I'll sort that out at some point.

You need loads of packages:

`pip install pyowm`

`sudo apt-get install imagemagick pngcrush apache2`

You also need a [rooted Kindle](http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle4NTHacking). I've found [kite](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=168270) to be useful for running stuff. Good luck with SSH'ing into it though.
